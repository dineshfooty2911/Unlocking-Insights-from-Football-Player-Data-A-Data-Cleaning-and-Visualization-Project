# Unlocking Insights from Football Player Data: A Data Wrangling and Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of football players downloaded from Kaggle using various data analysis and visualization tools. The goal is to gain insights into the relationships between different variables in the dataset and make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the data.

## Technology Stack
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Tableau:** For further exploration and analysis of the data.

## Project Description

### Data Import and Initial Exploration:
- The dataset of football players was imported into a Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas library.
- Initial exploration of the dataset included examining the first few rows, checking the shape of the dataset, and viewing basic statistics.

### Data Cleaning:
- Null values and unnecessary columns were removed to ensure the integrity of the data.
- Specific columns with image or logo URLs were dropped.
- Null values in critical columns were filled with appropriate values, while rows with a high percentage of missing data were dropped.
- The cleaned data was checked for duplicates and missing values, ensuring it was ready for analysis.

### Data Visualization:
- Visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
- Examples of visualizations include count plots for preferred foot, radar plots for player abilities, histograms for club distribution, and box plots for overall ratings by position.

### Advanced Exploration with Tableau:
- The cleaned DataFrame was exported to a CSV file and further explored in Tableau.
- Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards to gain deeper insights into the data.
- You can view the Tableau visualizations and dashboards [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FNZ8DRS85?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Impact
This project showcases the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex datasets. The insights gained from the analysis of the football player dataset can be used by coaches and team managers to make strategic decisions about team formation, recruitment, and training.

## Outcome
The project resulted in a deeper understanding of the relationships between different variables in the football player dataset. The insights gained enabled informed decision-making based on the data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis and visualization tools, showcasing the ability to analyze complex datasets to gain insights that can be used to make informed decisions.
