# Data-wrangling-and-Visualization
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of Football players, which is downloaded from Kaggle, using various data analysis and visualization tools. The dataset is imported into a Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas library and then cleaned to remove null values and unnecessary columns. The cleaned data is then visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to gain insights into the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

After completing the data analysis and visualization in the Jupyter Notebook, the DataFrame is exported to Tableau for further exploration and analysis. This enables the user to create interactive visualizations and perform more advanced data analysis to gain deeper insights into the dataset.

Overall, this project aims to showcase the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex datasets and making informed decisions based on the insights gained from the data.
